# heroscript
Python tool for shipping TCX files from Garmin Connect to Velohero and a local archive. Additional activity data will be merged from and to Strava. There is Web based GUI and a installer, so it can be used on mobile devices (Android).
Adapted for my use case, it's more a personal helper than a universal tool. Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/chs8691/heroscript/wiki) for the description.
